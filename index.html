There&rsquo;s not any other way to put it. You can either have an operating system that&rsquo;s backwards compatible to a point where it&rsquo;s inflexible in trying to make any changes because those changes could break compatibility with older software. You can have an operating system that is backwards compatible to a certain point, but after that point older software will no longer be supported, or you can have an operating system that isn&rsquo;t backwards compatible at all, in which all software has to be updated to support the changes made to each release of the operating system.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=./post/2021-10-18-manjarno/><p class="note title">Why I don't recommend Manjaro Linux</p><p class="note date">Oct 18, 2021</p><p class="note content">Introduction So on Twitter as a response to a tweet by Linus Tech Tips showing Linus&rsquo;s frustration with Linux, I quoted the tweet saying &ldquo;This is why you don&rsquo;t use Manjaro&rdquo; . That got many responses, a lot from Manjaro users telling me how great Manjaro is. Now I didn&rsquo;t expect that tweet to get as much attention as it did, or cause controversy. I respect people&rsquo;s distro choices, and I think Linux is all about freedom of choice, and people should have the choice to use whatever distro they want to use.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=./post/2021-09-18-installing-gentoo-on-the-pentium-iii/><p class="note title">Installing Gentoo on the Pentium III</p><p class="note date">Sep 18, 2021</p><p class="note content">This blog post targets EXPERIENCED Gentoo users only, I&rsquo;m not helping you, and you are on your own!

I&rsquo;ve tried a few other distros, like Gentoo, Fedora, Debian and I&rsquo;ve always eventually come back to Arch Linux. I decided to write this blog post to get into some of the reasons why that is.
Rolling Release This is a huge thing for me, I love rolling release distros, and I love having access to the latest software.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=./post/2021-09-12-learning-to-love-vim/><p class="note title">Learning to Love Vim</p><p class="note date">Sep 12, 2021</p><p class="note content">Introduction When I first learned about Vim I wasn&rsquo;t very enthusiastic about it, I wasn&rsquo;t very open minded and didn&rsquo;t want to use it because I didn&rsquo;t know how to use it. However, things have changed, and I&rsquo;m now using vim as my primary editor! I used to use Text Wrangler (back when I used a MacBook), then switched over to Visual Studio Code when I switched over to using Linux, I eventually settled on using Sublime Text, and still do use it for larger projects.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=./post/2021-08-26-installing-gentoo/><p class="note title">Installing Gentoo</p><p class="note date">Aug 26, 2021</p><p class="note content">Introduction Gentoo is a source based Linux distribution which is very flexible and can be customized to fit the user&rsquo;s needs. A bit ago I started using Gentoo Linux daily. EDIT: Back to using Arch Linux. Here&rsquo;s the install procedure, because a lot of people seem to think it&rsquo;s difficult.

To the point where I never need to boot back into Xorg anymore! KDE Plasma is my favorite desktop environment, atm. Plasma for a long time was the one thing holding me back from using Wayland. It wasn&rsquo;t that stable, and the experience on Xorg was overall far less buggy. Xorg is slowly going away, Wayland is the future.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=./post/2021-07-05-updating-old-archlinux-install/><p class="note title">Case Study: Updating old install of Arch Linux</p><p class="note date">Jul 05, 2021</p><p class="note content">Introduction So there&rsquo;s this myth that if Arch Linux gets too old then you can&rsquo;t update the install anymore. I don&rsquo;t exactly know what classifies as &ldquo;too old&rdquo; since I&rsquo;ve managed to update installs up to 2 years out of date. However, I decided to go a step further and update an install that&rsquo;s 5 years out of date.
Problems The best way to avoid running into serious problems is to read the Arch Linux news letter as it typically tells you how to fix any problems you may run into.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=./post/2021-06-15-linux-guide-for-windows-users/><p class="note title">How to switch from Windows to Linux</p><p class="note date">Jun 15, 2021</p><p class="note content">Warning Before getting into this it is assumed all your important data is backed up somewhere, whether that&rsquo;s a cloud service, or external device, this WILL wipe all your data, and I&rsquo;m not responsible for anything that goes wrong!
Introduction Microsoft announced their new Windows 11, (correction: the new Windows 11 was leaked, not officially announced) I hate it.

I replaced my MacBook a little over a year ago, so it hasn&rsquo;t been doing much lately. Introduction So macOS 10.13, it&rsquo;s ancient, at this point a lot of applications are dropping support, and it&rsquo;s happening really fast too. I still use my 2010 MacBook Pro as my secondary laptop because it&rsquo;s still quite useful as a little 13" laptop.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class=pagination><ul><li><a class=active href=./>1</a></li><li><a href=./page/2/>2</a></li><li><a href=./page/3/>3</a></li></ul></div></section><section id=footer><div style=display:flex;flex-direction:row;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between><p style=flex-shrink:0>Â©2022 alicela1n</p><p><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
