title: "Linux troubles again..."

Linux troubles again, this time it's my audio that's not working. I didn't even realize it wasn't working for a while. Then it randomly hit me, no audio. Obviously, this is not enough to convince me to switch to Windows, as I'm not a fan of that operating system. However it is really annoying so I'm gonna have to try and fix it.

# Diagnosing the problem
Let's see what shows up in `/proc/asound/card0`
```
[root@magenta-matrix ~]# ls -lah /proc/asound/card0

dr-xr-xr-x 21 root root 0 Mar 22 21:02 .

[root@magenta-matrix ~]#
```

Looks pretty typical, I noticed that I didn't have alsa-utils installed, time to install it. After installing it I ran `aplay -l`.
```
[root@magenta-matrix ~]# aplay -l

Again, pretty typical. Let's run `alsa-mixer`.
```
[root@magenta-matrix ~]# alsamixer
cannot open mixer: Host is down
[root@magenta-matrix ~]#
```
Oh?

Let's check the kernel logs!

Looks normal? I don't see why it's not working.

Maybe a kernel update? Oh nope... :/
I could try building the latest kernel from source but I don't want to.

I didn't even bother trying `pactl info`
```

Oh nothing looks out of the ordinary, so it looks normal again. Yet pavucontrol shows nothing!
![screenshot](/assets/linux-troubles-again/Screenshot_20210322_211309.png)

Hmm, maybe I could try reinstalling pipewire with `sudo pacman -S pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack pipewire` and rebooting? Sadly nope, doesn't work. :/
Last thing I'll try is falling back to the `linux-lts` kernel package. Unfortunately tho, that did not fix it, leading me to believe it's not a kernel problem after all.

# Pipewire
Pipewire is a new thing, replacement for pulseaudio. It's great when it works, but it might be problematic since it's really new. Maybe I should try switching back to pulseaudio!
My dependency tree is an absolute nightmare!
```
alice :: magenta-matrix [~] % sudo pacman -R pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack pipewire-alsa
checking dependencies...

```
I have plenty of btrfs snapshots so might as well live on the edge and do `sudo pacman -Rdd pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack pipewire-alsa`!

Installing pulseaudio:
```
$ sudo pacman -S pulseaudio pulseaudio-bluetooth pulseaudio-alsa pulseaudio-jack pulseaudio-zeroconf
```

Let's see if audio is fixed!
I'm back after rebooting typing this in vim with no graphical interface, because removing pipewire broke plasma! Using `nmtui` to connect to the internet!
`pacman -Syu $(pacman -Qqn) --overwrite="*"` to force reinstall all packages.
Reboot, and audio works! Pipewire was the problem!

# Conclusion
In conclusion pipewire was the problem, an update to pipewire broke audio! Maybe I should file a bug report, maybe there's already a bug report, I'll have to see, but for now I'm back on pulseaudio!
