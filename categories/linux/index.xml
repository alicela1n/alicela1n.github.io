That got many responses, a lot from Manjaro users telling me how great Manjaro is. Now I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that tweet to get as much attention as it did, or cause controversy. I respect people&amp;rsquo;s distro choices, and I think Linux is all about freedom of choice, and people should have the choice to use whatever distro they want to use.</description></item><item><title>Installing Gentoo on the Pentium III</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-09-18-installing-gentoo-on-the-pentium-iii/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 19:16:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-09-18-installing-gentoo-on-the-pentium-iii/</guid><description>This blog post targets EXPERIENCED Gentoo users only, I&amp;rsquo;m not helping you, and you are on your own! The future is uncertain, since this setup involves using old versions of some packages, and patches for others, it&amp;rsquo;s uncertain whether or not it&amp;rsquo;ll work tomorrow, or whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to update this install in the future, so use at your own risk!

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few other distros, like Gentoo, Fedora, Debian and I&amp;rsquo;ve always eventually come back to Arch Linux. I decided to write this blog post to get into some of the reasons why that is.
Rolling Release This is a huge thing for me, I love rolling release distros, and I love having access to the latest software.</description></item><item><title>Installing Gentoo</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-08-26-installing-gentoo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 23:45:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-08-26-installing-gentoo/</guid><description>Introduction Gentoo is a source based Linux distribution which is very flexible and can be customized to fit the user&amp;rsquo;s needs. A bit ago I started using Gentoo Linux daily. EDIT: Back to using Arch Linux. Here&amp;rsquo;s the install procedure, because a lot of people seem to think it&amp;rsquo;s difficult.
Creating a live USB Obviously before we can begin, we need to boot the computer into some kind of environment. I opt for systemrescuecd.</description></item><item><title>Using Wayland daily on KDE Plasma, My Experience</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-07-14-using-wayland-daily-on-plasma/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:30:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-07-14-using-wayland-daily-on-plasma/</guid><description>Introduction Ever since KDE Plasma 5.21 it&amp;rsquo;s been fully usable under Wayland. To the point where I never need to boot back into Xorg anymore! KDE Plasma is my favorite desktop environment, atm. Plasma for a long time was the one thing holding me back from using Wayland. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that stable, and the experience on Xorg was overall far less buggy. Xorg is slowly going away, Wayland is the future.</description></item><item><title>Case Study: Updating old install of Arch Linux</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-07-05-updating-old-archlinux-install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 15:12:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-07-05-updating-old-archlinux-install/</guid><description>Introduction So there&amp;rsquo;s this myth that if Arch Linux gets too old then you can&amp;rsquo;t update the install anymore. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what classifies as &amp;ldquo;too old&amp;rdquo; since I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to update installs up to 2 years out of date. However, I decided to go a step further and update an install that&amp;rsquo;s 5 years out of date.
Problems The best way to avoid running into serious problems is to read the Arch Linux news letter as it typically tells you how to fix any problems you may run into.</description></item><item><title>How to switch from Windows to Linux</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-06-15-linux-guide-for-windows-users/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2021 15:12:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-06-15-linux-guide-for-windows-users/</guid><description>Warning Before getting into this it is assumed all your important data is backed up somewhere, whether that&amp;rsquo;s a cloud service, or external device, this WILL wipe all your data, and I&amp;rsquo;m not responsible for anything that goes wrong!
Introduction Microsoft announced their new Windows 11, (correction: the new Windows 11 was leaked, not officially announced) I hate it. This inspired me to write a blog post to help Windows users switch over from Windows 10 to Linux, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be focusing on Kubuntu.</description></item><item><title>Using Kubuntu on my old MacBook Pro</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-04-11-kubuntu-on-old-macbook-pro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Apr 2021 11:23:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-04-11-kubuntu-on-old-macbook-pro/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used a 2010 MacBook Pro as my main laptop for a couple years, it&amp;rsquo;s old, slow, and the last version of macOS to support it is 10.13.6. I replaced my MacBook a little over a year ago, so it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been doing much lately. Introduction So macOS 10.13, it&amp;rsquo;s ancient, at this point a lot of applications are dropping support, and it&amp;rsquo;s happening really fast too. I still use my 2010 MacBook Pro as my secondary laptop because it&amp;rsquo;s still quite useful as a little 13&amp;quot; laptop.</description></item><item><title>Installing Gentoo on Raspberry Pi 4</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-04-06-gentoo-on-pi-4-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 11:12:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-04-06-gentoo-on-pi-4-notes/</guid><description>Introduction If you remember Sakaki&amp;rsquo;s Gentoo images for the Raspberry Pi 4, they were great. It was one of the best performing distros for the Raspberry Pi 4. Since Sakaki no longer updates them they are effectively dead.
Gentoo is one of my favorite Linux distros because of it&amp;rsquo;s insane level of customization and control, over just about everything. In the make.conf you have a lot of control over your installation.</description></item><item><title>Linux troubles again...</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-03-22-linux-troubles-again/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 20:59:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2021-03-22-linux-troubles-again/</guid><description>Linux troubles again, this time it&amp;rsquo;s my audio that&amp;rsquo;s not working. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for a while. Then it randomly hit me, no audio. Obviously, this is not enough to convince me to switch to Windows, as I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of that operating system. However it is really annoying so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to try and fix it.

Anyways I might one day find the motivation to get back into blogging, who knows these days. Anyways I decided to write this post because I&amp;rsquo;m using Gentoo now, a source based Linux distro.
Why Gentoo? I was using Arch for a while, then started looking into Gentoo. I liked the way it&amp;rsquo;s package management works, being source based.</description></item><item><title>Need to use a different Linux distro?

Whether it be that I need to use a different version of the GCC compiler than the one in the distro&amp;rsquo;s repos or something else. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Gentoo, and some other ones like Fedora, Manjaro, openSUSE, Void Linux but none of them seemed to solve the problems I was having where I always need access to a package not in that distro&amp;rsquo;s repositories, Arch is the best right for me right now because it has the AUR (Arch User Repository) which has most stuff but not everything.</description></item><item><title>Running Void Linux in Chroot on Android</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2020-05-06-running-void-linux-in-chroot-on-android/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 12:16:30 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2020-05-06-running-void-linux-in-chroot-on-android/</guid><description>Introduction So I decided to mess around with my Fire 7 tablet and see if I could get a chroot environment of Linux. I used Void because it is quite lightweight and is perfect for testing! Tutorial So first off this is what you will need:
A rooted Android device Linux A reasonable amount of free space (at least 8GB) Void Linux Root FS Now we can get started!</description></item><item><title>AARCH64 Arch Linux ARM on Raspberry Pi 4</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2020-04-10-aarch64-arch-linux-arm-on-raspberry-pi-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 12:16:30 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2020-04-10-aarch64-arch-linux-arm-on-raspberry-pi-4/</guid><description>Introduction So you may know about the Raspberry Pi, a single board computer designed for embedded applications and DIY projects. You may also know that some people use them as desktop computers. However, one of the biggest problems when it comes to the Pi 4 is poor 64bit support. There is little to none in mainline and the downstream kernel is a bit old. We won&amp;rsquo;t be fixing that problem but we will be running Arch Linux on the Pi 4 in 64bit mode, be aware that we are using an older kernel and it&amp;rsquo;s not the latest mainline support.</description></item><item><title>Restoring and updating iOS devices from Linux with iDeviceRestore</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2020-01-07-restoring-and-updating-ios-devices-from-linux-with-idevicerestore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 13:14:30 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2020-01-07-restoring-and-updating-ios-devices-from-linux-with-idevicerestore/</guid><description>Introduction You may be a Linux user, but you may have an iPhone as well. Occasionally there will be times when you&amp;rsquo;ll need to restore and update your iPhone. You may think that because you&amp;rsquo;re using Linux you are unable to restore or update your iOS device without a virtual machine or dualboot. Thankfully this is not true. Thanks to the developers behind libimobiledevice there are new tools to do the restore and update process directly from Linux.</description></item><item><title>One year of Linux on the 2010 MacBook Pro</title><link>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2019-12-24-one-year-of-linux-on-the-2010-macbook-pro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 15:09:34 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alicela1n.github.io/post/2019-12-24-one-year-of-linux-on-the-2010-macbook-pro/</guid><description>Introduction So I got the 2010 MacBook Pro to use as a MacBook for school and on the go. I started using macOS in 2016 when I built my first hackintosh because I liked the user interface, the dock at the bottom, the bar at the top, and it looked nice together. However as I started getting into embedded development and some other stuff I quickly realized that macOS was insufficient for what I needed to accomplish.</description></item></channel></rss>
