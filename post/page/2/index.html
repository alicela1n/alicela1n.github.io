It was one of the best performing distros for the Raspberry Pi 4. Since Sakaki no longer updates them they are effectively dead.
Gentoo is one of my favorite Linux distros because of it&rsquo;s insane level of customization and control, over just about everything. In the make.conf you have a lot of control over your installation.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=../../../post/2021-03-22-linux-troubles-again/><p class="note title">Linux troubles again...</p><p class="note date">Mar 21, 2021</p><p class="note content">Linux troubles again, this time it&rsquo;s my audio that&rsquo;s not working. I didn&rsquo;t even realize it wasn&rsquo;t working for a while. Then it randomly hit me, no audio. Obviously, this is not enough to convince me to switch to Windows, as I&rsquo;m not a fan of that operating system. However it is really annoying so I&rsquo;m gonna have to try and fix it.

Anyways I might one day find the motivation to get back into blogging, who knows these days. Anyways I decided to write this post because I&rsquo;m using Gentoo now, a source based Linux distro.
Why Gentoo? I was using Arch for a while, then started looking into Gentoo. I liked the way it&rsquo;s package management works, being source based.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=../../../post/2020-10-31-make-your-own-dotfiles-repo/><p class="note title">Make your own dotfiles repo today</p><p class="note date">Oct 31, 2020</p><p class="note content">Introduction Dotfiles, we all love them. If you&rsquo;re anything like me and use the command line a lot you surely use dotfiles. Things like your vimrc, zshrc, tmux config, etc are all dotfiles.
So why should you make a repo with your dotfiles? A github repo including all your dotfiles makes it easier to deploy them later, also makes it possible for other people to use them. I get asked occasionally, &ldquo;how did you make your setup look like that?<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=../../../post/2020-08-23-osx-10%2e5-ppc-in-qemu-with-working-audio/><p class="note title">Working audio in Mac OS X 10.5 (or 10.4) PPC in QEMU</p><p class="note date">Aug 23, 2020</p><p class="note content">Introduction I&rsquo;ve been interested in old operating systems in a while, especially Apple ones. I love QEMU because it lets me emulate different (and a lot of obscure) operating systems and architectures that I otherwise would not have access to. This includes PPC Mac OS X, however one problem is that audio has never worked for me, since QEMU doesn&rsquo;t emulate a supported sound card.
Passing through an audio device? Inconvenient, and I need to find one that is supported first.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=../../../post/2020-08-22-just-systemd-nspawn-it/><p class="note title">Need to use a different Linux distro?

Whether it be that I need to use a different version of the GCC compiler than the one in the distro&rsquo;s repos or something else. I&rsquo;ve been trying Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Gentoo, and some other ones like Fedora, Manjaro, openSUSE, Void Linux but none of them seemed to solve the problems I was having where I always need access to a package not in that distro&rsquo;s repositories, Arch is the best right for me right now because it has the AUR (Arch User Repository) which has most stuff but not everything.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=../../../post/2020-06-26-dumping-shsh-and-restoring-iphone-without-losing-ios-version/><p class="note title">Dumping SHSH and restoring 32bit iOS device</p><p class="note date">Jun 26, 2020</p><p class="note content">!This was one of my quick written guides so if you have any improvements feel free to pull request them in!
Introduction Sometimes you might be in a situation where your 32bit iPhone is bootlooping, passcode locked, or you are unable to jailbreak it. You think all hope is lost and you must restore, updating to the latest supported iOS version. That&rsquo;s not true. There&rsquo;s a way to restore the iPhone without updating to the latest version of iOS, then you get to keep the currently installed iOS version and not have to worry about it ever again as long as you keep your SHSH.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=../../../post/2020-06-02-using-old-computers-in-2020/><p class="note title">Operating systems to use on old computers in 2020</p><p class="note date">Jun 02, 2020</p><p class="note content">Introduction Here&rsquo;s a hypothetical situation, imagine you are using your computer and suddenly it stops powering on. No apparent reason, it just simply doesn&rsquo;t work anymore. However you do have a Pentium 4 computer sitting in your closet collecting dust. So being that it&rsquo;s your only functional computer, you plug it in and power it up. It runs an operating system from many years ago, Windows XP or an old Linux distro probably.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=../../../post/2020-05-14-taking-a-look-at-reactos/><p class="note title">Taking a look at ReactOS, a real open source Windows XP replacement?</p><p class="note date">May 14, 2020</p><p class="note content">Introduction I got bored and decided to check out ReactOS, an open source alternative to Windows. It is the effort of a team who did some clean room reverse engineering of Windows and wrote their code from scratch .
Impressions ReactOS is quite good for what it is, it is quite unstable and has poor hardware support but that is to be expected. I got it to boot on a couple computers laying around the house but I couldn&rsquo;t get the drivers to install.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class=pagination><ul><li><a href=../../../post/>1</a></li><li><a class=active href=../../../post/page/2/>2</a></li><li><a href=../../../post/page/3/>3</a></li></ul></div></section><section id=footer><div style=display:flex;flex-direction:row;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between><p style=flex-shrink:0>Â©2022 alicela1n</p><p><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
